# Reverse Coding Game

Welcome to the Reverse Coding Game! In this game, your challenge is to uncover the hidden rule or function (the "black box") that transforms given inputs into corresponding outputs. You will be presented with a series of input-output pairs, and your task is to deduce the underlying pattern or rule governing the transformation.

## Example

Consider the following example:

| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
|   1   |   1    |
|   2   |   4    |
|   3   |   9    |
|   4   |   16   |

In this case, the pattern is that the output is the square of the input. The hidden rule is expressed as $f(x) = x^2$.

## How to Play

1. You will be provided with a set of input-output pairs.
2. Analyze the examples and try to identify the underlying rule or function.
3. Once you believe you've discovered the pattern, express it as a mathematical function.
4. Submit your guess and see if you've successfully reverse-coded the black box!

## Tips

- Look for common arithmetic or geometric progressions.
- Consider logical operations or mathematical functions.
- Think about how the output relates to the input.

## Examples

1. **Arithmetic Progression:**
   - Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Output: 2, 4, 6, 8
   - Rule: $f(x) = 2x$

2. **Geometric Progression:**
   - Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Output: 3, 6, 12, 24
   - Rule: $f(x) = 3 \times 2^x$

3. **Logical Operation:**
   - Input: 1, 2, 3, 4
   - Output: 1, 0, 1, 0
   - Rule: $f(x) = 1 - (x \mod 2)$


## Have Fun!

Enjoy the challenge of uncovering the hidden rules in this reverse coding game. May your logical reasoning skills shine!

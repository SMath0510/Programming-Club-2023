# Code Golf Introduction

## Welcome to Code Golf!

Code Golf is a unique and exciting programming competition that challenges participants to write the shortest possible code to solve a given problem. The goal is to minimize the number of characters in your source code while still producing the correct output. It's a fun way to showcase your programming skills and creativity in finding concise solutions.

### Example Code and Problem

Let's dive into a simple example to illustrate the concept of Code Golf:

**Problem: Reverse a String**

Write a program or function that takes a string as input and outputs the string in reverse order.

**Example Solution (in Python):**

```python
def reverse_string(s):
    print(s[::-1])

reverse_string("Code Golf")  # Output: "floG edoC"
```

In Code Golf, you would aim to achieve the same result with the fewest characters possible.

### Learning Resources

If you're new to Code Golf and want to enhance your skills, here are some resources to get you started:

- [Code Golf Stack Exchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/): A community-driven platform where Code Golf enthusiasts share challenges, solutions, and discuss various programming techniques.

- [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/): A wiki that presents the same programming task in multiple languages, allowing you to compare solutions and learn concise coding practices.

### Judging Criteria

Code Golf submissions are typically judged based on the following criteria:

- **Code Length:** The primary metric is the length of your code. Shorter solutions are generally favored, provided they produce the correct output.

- **Correctness:** The code must solve the specified problem accurately.

- **Readability:** While conciseness is essential, maintain a balance with readability. Code that is too cryptic may be harder to understand and maintain.

Remember, Code Golf is not only about finding the shortest solution but also about crafting elegant and efficient code. Happy coding!

# Towers and Soldiers Game

## Overview

The "Towers and Soldiers" game is a strategic multiplayer board game where players compete to control towers by strategically allocating soldiers. The game involves allocating a fixed number of soldiers to a fixed number of towers, with the winner determined through pairwise comparisons of tower configurations.

## How to Play

1. **Setup:**
   - Enter the total number of soldiers (`n`).
   - Enter the total number of towers (`k`).
   - Enter the number of players (`p`).

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns allocating soldiers to towers.
   - Each player enters the number of soldiers for each tower, ensuring the total matches the initial number of soldiers.

3. **Pairwise Comparisons:**
   - After all players have allocated soldiers, the game conducts pairwise comparisons of tower configurations.
   - The player who controls more towers in each comparison wins that comparison.

4. **Round Winner:**
   - The player who wins the most pairwise comparisons is declared the winner of the round.

5. **Scoring:**
